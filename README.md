"# ArApp" 

Tested: Working on computer with webcam. For phone, working on S20+ using opera browser, and not on chrome and firefox browser. Reason being the script is not able to ask user for selection of cameras to be used for AR, given that the S20+ has 6 cameras in total.

To run: Need to self sign cert and key to host https local server, as Ar.JS requires camera permission and is only possible on https.

Execute: npm start

Go to https:localhost:3000/ar.html on browser
